# LogSort

LogSort is a simple utility designed to read all lines of a log file, and
re-write each line of the file containing a key phrase back to a new sorted
log file. 

Note that this program copy's all lines of a file too a list of lists, each list
being a line from the file. Due to this, there is inherently limit to the size of 
the log file which can be sorted.
