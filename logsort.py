"""
This utility allows you to create a new .txt file from a log file containing
ONLY the lines which contain the key phrase defined by the user.
Each line from the log file is read, split, and stored in a list,
passed to a linear search function which searches for the key phrase in the 
list and if the condition is met, the line is written back to the log file 
in the initial format which is was read as.

NOTES:
- Files created and read from same directory as logsort.py
- Word split is the character in your log which separates each word. For
  example if my line is "Hello World" a space (" ") would be my word split.
