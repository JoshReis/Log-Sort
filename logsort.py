"""
This utility allows you to create a new .txt file from a log file containing
ONLY the lines which contain the key phrase defined by the user.

NOTES:
- Files created and read from same directory as logsort.py

- Word Split is the character in your log which separates each word. For
  example if my line is "Hello World" a space would be my word split.
