"""
This utility allows you to create a new .txt file from a log file containing
ONLY the lines which contain the key phrase defined by the user.
The data from the log file is read, split, and stored in a list, later to be
passed to a linear search function which searches for the key phrase in ALL
lines stored in the list and if the condition is met, the line is written back
to the log file in the initial format which is was read as.
NOTES:
- Files created and read from same directory as logsort.py
- Word split is the character in your log which separates each word. For
  example if my line is "Hello World" a space would be my word split.
